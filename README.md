## Configuration

### Extended Schema

#### x_editor_autocompletion

Configuration for autocompletion of a field from remote source. Field to be autocompleted must have the `x_editor_autocompletion` property
with configuration object that has the following properties below.

```
{
  url: string; (remote source url that returns the autocompletion results)
  path: string; (path to array of autocompletion results in response from the url, seprated by dot '.')
  size: number; (maximum number of items to be showed)
}
```

Note that:

- query string is appended to `url`, so it should end like `.../foo?bar=`
- autocompletion results array which is located in `path`, must be a array of objects which have `text` property inside.

#### x_editor_hidden

Flag to hide fields in the record from the editor's UI.

```
boolean
```

Note that:

- It deletes fields that are set `x_editor_hidden: true` from the record, before rendering the UI.

#### x_editor_disabled

Flag to disable fields that should be displayed in the UI, but aren't supposed to be edited.

```
boolean
```

Note that:

- It overrides all other types. For instance, if a field enum and `x_editor_disabled` is set, then it is rendered as simple `div` instead of disabled `enum` component (dropdown).

#### x_editor_always_show

Flag to show fields on the UI, even if they aren't present in the record.

```
boolean
```

#### x_editor_priority

Indicator to be used for sorting all fields on the UI.
Larger priority fields appears up-most/left-most on the UI.

```
number
```

```
default: 0
```

#### x_editor_validation_url

Url to be used for backend validation.

```
string
```

Note that:
  it should return errors in the same format as [remote-validation-response.json](./example/mock-data/remote-validation-response.json) 

#### x_editor_previews

Configuration for previews to be displayed in previewer (on the right side, below menu).

```
[
  {
    name: string; (name of the tab which preview is displayed)
    type: string; (type of the preview, such as "pdf")
    url_path: string; (dot separated path to url in the record)
  }
]
```
